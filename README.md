# Open Jakarta Air Quality Data Pipeline Project
This project demonstrates the creation data pipeline using Open Air Quality data from a public S3 bucket. It aims to balance simplicity for newcomers with enough complexity to introduce important data engineering concepts. The pipeline extracts, transforms, and visualizes data in near real-time, ensuring the dashboard reflects live updates as data evolves.
